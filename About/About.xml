    <description>Vanilla Storytellers Expanded is a brand new mod series featuring standalone storytellers, bringing new, unique mechanics to the game.

“Perry Persistent conveys a story the same way he handles his investigations - with determination and attention to details.

He will constantly keep you on your toes, as every day can bring you closer to the end of his investigation.“

Perry Persistent comes with the following traits:

Large amount of events
This storyteller will drastically increase the amount of events, to the point where new events will keep happening almost every day, constantly keeping you on your toes. In addition to that, faction quests will also be given to you on a regular basis.

Population doubled
This storyteller allows for double the usual population. This means that the game will be somewhat more friendly until you hit a very big colony size.

Man in the Coat
In addition to the Man in Black, a very rare Man in the Coat can arrive to complete his investigation. Man in the Coat brings a more powerful gun than the Man in Black.</description>
